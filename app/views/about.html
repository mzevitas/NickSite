	<h2>I am Nicky Will</h2>

		<p>
			Nicky Will was born March 21st, 1991 in Rochester, NY. At a young age he was exposed to various styles of music ranging from 80's Rock, to country, along with the 90's pop boom that exploded the music scene. He began singing in the school choir in 1st grade as most kids do but always took it more serious than most. Throughout the next few years, Nicky would continue school choir. It wasn't until a live broadcast of a New Years Eve concert aired on the TV, that Will realized he wanted to be on that same stage. In 9th grade he was forced to drop choir due to his grades, but in an effort to continue singing he convinced his parents to get him vocal lessons. Nicky wrote his first song in 10th grade, recording it with a computer microphone and a podcast software. He continued writing songs sporadically throughout his High School years but didn't truly begin his journey until he graduated years later. Just month's into the summer, Will's family convinced him to search for local producers he could potentially work with. <br><br>In Mid-Summer of 2009 Nicky began working with a Hip-Hop producer in the area. Over the year of collaborating he became a seasoned writer, putting out his first self titled project. Throughout that year he learned production and engineering along with the business aspects of running a music career. After parting ways with his producer, Nicky would go on to release 2 self produced projects until 2012 when he decided to move to the ATL to continue his journey. Now 2016, Will has worked with local Atlanta producers and dropped a few Top 40 singles, a few winning "Song Of The Month". Set to release his first self-Produced project in 5 years,"Dear World" encapsulates Nicky's cross genre style with an in-your-face delivery set to create a national buzz.
